        Refund, Resend, and Returns Policy for PrepPal
      </h1>

      <h2 class="font-weight-bold">1. Delayed Orders</h2>
      <p class="font-weight-normal">
        In the event that an order experiences significant delays, PrepPal will
        take the following steps:
      </p>
      <ul class="font-weight-normal">
        <li>
          If an order for the USA is delayed for more than 45 days (counting
          from the date of payment), or 60 days for other countries (except for
          certain countries with different shipping methods), PrepPal will
          investigate the issue.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="font-weight-bold">2. Delivered Orders</h2>
      <p class="font-weight-normal">
        If tracking information indicates that an order has been delivered and
        your customer claims non-receipt, PrepPal will:
      </p>
      <ul class="font-weight-normal">
        <li>
          Require a non-delivery certification issued by the local post office
          with an official seal.
        </li>
        <li>
          Address any tracking information alerts (incorrect/insufficient
          address, unknown recipient, etc.) with the respective local
          distributor.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the order has been delivered and your customer still claims
          non-receipt, PrepPal will not be held responsible.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="font-weight-bold">3. Products Damaged</h2>
      <p class="font-weight-normal">
        In the event that products arrive damaged, PrepPal will:
      </p>
      <ul class="font-weight-normal">
        <li>Offer a full refund or replacement for badly damaged products.</li>
        <li>
          Offer a partial refund or replacement for products that arrive
          partially damaged.
        </li>
        <li>
          Request photos or videos of damaged items to prove the damage. If
          photos do not suffice, please provide a video.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="font-weight-bold">4. Incorrect or Missing Products</h2>
      <p class="font-weight-normal">
        In the event that products arrive damaged, PrepPal will:
      </p>
      <ul class="font-weight-normal">
        <li>Offer a full refund or replacement for badly damaged products.</li>
        <li>
          Offer a partial refund or replacement for products that arrive
          partially damaged.
        </li>
        <li>
          Request photos or videos of damaged items to prove the damage. If
          photos do not suffice, please provide a video.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="font-weight-bold">Important Notes</h2>
      <p class="font-weight-normal">
        PrepPal can only open disputes while the order status is not closed.
      </p>
      <p class="font-weight-normal">
        Force Majeure: PrepPal is not responsible for product damage or shipping
        delays caused by factors beyond its control.
      </p>
      <p class="font-weight-normal">
        Shipping Method Limits: Some shipping methods are not trackable in
        certain areas, and PrepPal will not accept disputes related to these
        cases.
      </p>
      <p class="font-weight-normal">
        Destination Limits: There are limitations on shipping to specific
        countries, and PrepPal will not accept disputes for orders shipped to
        these regions.
      </p>

      <h2 class="font-weight-bold">Return</h2>
      <p class="font-weight-normal">
        Products can be returned to CJ China warehouses, but it's not
        recommended due to the high international shipping cost and potential
        damage during the return process.
      </p>

      <h2 class="font-weight-bold">Unacceptable Disputes</h2>
      <p class="font-weight-normal">
        PrepPal will not accept unreasonable disputes, including issues such as
        buyer preferences, product descriptions, unusual smells, incorrect
        orders by the buyer, address errors, and more.
      </p>

      <p class="font-weight-normal">
        PrepPal and CJDropshipping.com retain the right to modify this
        policy at any time, with the modified agreement becoming valid upon the
        signature of both parties.
